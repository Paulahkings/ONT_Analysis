    "BulkVis is a program written in Python3 using Bokeh to visualise raw squiggle data from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) bulkfiles. [Bulkvis](https://github.com/LooseLab/bulkvis) scans a folder containing bulk FAST5 files at startup. An individual file is selected and specific channels plotted. Basic metadata are displayed to the user. To navigate coordinates are input in the format `channel: start_time-end_time`. Alternatively pasting a FASTQ read header from a base called read will jump to its channel, time and raw signal from the bulk FAST5 file (Payne et al., 2019). Further information on how to strt bulkvis can be found [here](https://bulkvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html).\n",
